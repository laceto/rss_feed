      "\n",
      "### 1. Moving Average Order\n",
      "- **Short-term EMA (50-day):** 150.25\n",
      "- **Medium-term EMA (100-day):** 148.75\n",

      "\n",
      "The order of the moving averages is: Short-term > Medium-term > Long-term.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Alignment\n",
      "- The moving averages are in a bullish alignment, indicating a potential uptrend. This alignment suggests that the stock price is currently above its recent historical averages, which is typically a positive sign for upward momentum.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Slope of the Averages and Momentum\n",
      "- **Short-term EMA (150.25) > Medium-term EMA (148.75) > Long-term EMA (145.5):** This sequence indicates that the moving averages are sloping upwards, which is a sign of positive momentum.\n",
      "- The upward slope of these averages suggests that the stock has been gaining strength over time, reinforcing the bullish trend.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Trend Phase\n",
      "- The stock is in an **uptrend phase**. The alignment and slope of the moving averages, along with the relative closing price (1.05), indicate that the stock is performing well relative to its benchmark.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Trading Implication\n",
      "- **Bullish Outlook:** The current setup suggests a continuation of the uptrend. Traders might consider entering long positions or holding existing long positions.\n",
      "- **Entry Point:** Consider entering on pullbacks to the short-term EMA (around 150.25) for a better risk-reward ratio.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. Spread Interpretation\n",
      "- **Spread between Short-term and Medium-term (1.0%):** Indicates a moderate short-term momentum.\n",
      "- **Spread between Medium-term and Long-term (2.2%):** Suggests a solid medium-term trend.\n",
      "- **Spread between Short-term and Long-term (3.2%):** Confirms a strong overall trend.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 7. RSI Analysis\n",
      "- **RSI Value: 65**\n",
      "  - The RSI is above 50, indicating bullish momentum.\n",
      "  - It is below the overbought threshold of 70, suggesting there is still room for the stock to move higher before becoming overbought.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 8. Practical Trade Rules\n",
      "- **Stop Loss:** Place a stop loss slightly below the medium-term EMA (148.75) to protect against downside risk.\n",
      "- **Take Profit:** Consider taking profits incrementally as the stock approaches key resistance levels or if the RSI approaches overbought levels (70+).\n",
      "- **Add to Position:** If the stock pulls back to the short-term EMA (150.25) and shows signs of support, consider adding to the position.\n",
      "- **Trend Strength and RSI Combination:**\n",
      "  - Strong trend (MA alignment + spread) combined with a non-overbought RSI suggests a favorable environment for long positions.\n",
      "  - Monitor RSI for signs of overbought conditions, which may indicate a potential pullback or consolidation phase.\n",
      "\n",

Slope of the Averages and Momentum\\n- **Positive Slope:** If all moving averages are sloping upwards, it indicates positive momentum and a potential continuation of the uptrend.\\n- **Negative Slope:** If all moving averages are sloping downwards, it suggests negative momentum and a potential continuation of the downtrend.\\n\\n### 4. Trend Phase\\n- **Accumulation Phase:** If the short-term average is crossing above the medium and long-term averages from below, it may indicate the start of an uptrend.\\n- **Distribution Phase:** If the short-term average is crossing below the medium and long-term averages from above, it may indicate the start of a downtrend.\\n\\n### 5. Trading Implication\\n- **Bullish Scenario:** Consider entering long positions if the moving averages are in bullish alignment and the slopes are positive.\\n- **Bearish Scenario:** Consider entering short positions if the moving averages are in bearish alignment and the slopes are negative.\\n\\n### 6. Spread Interpretation\\n- **Spread between Short-term and Medium-term (`spread_stmt`):** A large positive spread indicates strong short-term momentum. A narrowing spread may suggest weakening momentum.\\n- **Spread between Medium-term and Long-term (`spread_mtlt`):** A large positive spread indicates strong medium-term momentum. A narrowing spread may suggest a potential trend reversal.\\n- **Spread between Short-term and Long-term (`spread_stlt`):** A large positive spread indicates a strong overall trend. A narrowing spread may suggest consolidation or a potential reversal.\\n\\n### 7. RSI Analysis\\n- **Overbought (>70):** The stock may be overbought, indicating a potential pullback or reversal.\\n- **Oversold (<30):** The stock may be oversold, indicating a potential bounce or reversal.\\n- **Neutral (30-70):** The RSI is in a neutral zone, suggesting no immediate overbought or oversold conditions.\\n\\n### 8. Practical Trade Rules\\n- **Stop Loss:** Set a stop loss below the recent swing low for long positions or above the recent swing high for short positions to manage risk.\\n- **Take Profit:** Consider taking profits at key resistance levels for long positions or support levels for short positions.\\n- **Add to Position:** Consider adding to a position if the trend strengthens (e.g., moving averages widen further apart in the direction of the trade).\\n- **Combination of Trend Strength and RSI:**\\n  - **Strong Trend + Overbought RSI:** Be cautious of potential pullbacks; consider tightening stop losses.\\n  - **Strong Trend + Oversold RSI:** Look for buying opportunities in an uptrend or selling opportunities in a downtrend.\\n  - **Weak Trend + Neutral RSI:** Consider staying out of the market until a clearer trend emerges.\\n\\nBy analyzing these components, traders can make informed decisions based on the current market conditions and adjust their strategies accordingly.\",\n",

Slope of the Averages and Momentum\\n- **Positive Slope:** Indicates upward momentum if the moving averages are increasing.\\n- **Negative Slope:** Indicates downward momentum if the moving averages are decreasing.\\n- **Flat Slope:** Suggests a lack of momentum or a consolidation phase.\\n\\n### 4. Trend Phase\\n- **Uptrend:** Characterized by a bullish alignment and positive slope.\\n- **Downtrend:** Characterized by a bearish alignment and negative slope.\\n- **Sideways/Consolidation:** Characterized by flat slopes and mixed alignment.\\n\\n### 5. Trading Implication\\n- **Bullish Scenario:** Consider long positions if the trend is up and momentum is strong.\\n- **Bearish Scenario:** Consider short positions if the trend is down and momentum is strong.\\n- **Neutral Scenario:** Avoid new positions or consider range-bound strategies if the trend is sideways.\\n\\n### 6. Spread Interpretation\\n- **Spread between Short-term and Medium-term (`spread_stmt`):**\\n  - A large positive spread indicates strong short-term momentum.\\n  - A narrowing spread may suggest weakening momentum or a potential reversal.\\n- **Spread between Medium-term and Long-term (`spread_mtlt`):**\\n  - A large positive spread supports a sustained trend.\\n  - A narrowing spread may indicate a trend weakening.\\n- **Spread between Short-term and Long-term (`spread_stlt`):**\\n  - A large positive spread indicates strong overall trend strength.\\n  - A narrowing spread suggests potential consolidation or reversal.\\n\\n### 7. RSI Analysis\\n- **RSI < 30:** Indicates the stock may be oversold, potential for a bullish reversal.\\n- **RSI > 70:** Indicates the stock may be overbought, potential for a bearish reversal.\\n- **RSI between 30 and 70:** Suggests a neutral condition, aligning with the current trend.\\n\\n### 8. Practical Trade Rules\\n- **Stop Loss:** Set below the recent swing low for long positions or above the recent swing high for short positions.\\n- **Take Profit:** Use a risk-reward ratio of at least 1:2, or target key resistance/support levels.\\n- **Add to Position:** Consider adding if the trend strengthens (e.g., increasing spread and RSI confirming trend direction).\\n- **Combination of Trend Strength and RSI:**\\n  - **Strong Trend + RSI Confirmation:** Favor trend-following strategies.\\n  - **Weakening Trend + RSI Divergence:** Be cautious of potential reversals.\\n\\nBy analyzing these components, traders can make informed decisions based on the current market conditions and the stock's technical indicators.

      "- **Short-term EMA:** Below both medium and long-term EMAs, indicating short-term weakness.\n",
      "- **Medium-term EMA:** Below the long-term EMA, reinforcing the bearish sentiment.\n",
      "- **Momentum:** The negative spread between the EMAs suggests a lack of upward momentum and potential continuation of a bearish trend.\n",

      "- **Medium-term EMA (100-day):** 148.75\n",

      "\n",
      "The order of the moving averages is: Short-term > Medium-term > Long-term.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Alignment\n",
      "- The moving averages are in a bullish alignment, indicating a potential uptrend. This alignment suggests that the stock price is currently above its recent historical averages, which is typically a positive sign for upward momentum.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Slope of the Averages and Momentum\n",
      "- **Short-term EMA (150.25) > Medium-term EMA (148.75) > Long-term EMA (145.5):** This sequence indicates that the moving averages are sloping upwards, which is a sign of positive momentum.\n",
      "- The upward slope of these averages suggests that the stock has been gaining strength over time, reinforcing the bullish trend.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. Trend Phase\n",
      "- The stock is in an **uptrend phase**. The alignment and slope of the moving averages, along with the relative closing price (1.05), indicate that the stock is performing well relative to its benchmark.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5. Trading Implication\n",
      "- **Bullish Outlook:** The current setup suggests a continuation of the uptrend. Traders might consider entering long positions or holding existing long positions.\n",
      "- **Entry Point:** Consider entering on pullbacks to the short-term EMA (around 150.25) for a better risk-reward ratio.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 6. Spread Interpretation\n",
      "- **Spread between Short-term and Medium-term (1.0%):** Indicates a moderate short-term momentum.\n",
      "- **Spread between Medium-term and Long-term (2.2%):** Suggests a solid medium-term trend.\n",

      "\n",
      "### 7. RSI Analysis\n",
      "- **RSI Value: 65**\n",
      "  - The RSI is above 50, indicating bullish momentum.\n",
      "  - It is below the overbought threshold of 70, suggesting there is still room for the stock to move higher before becoming overbought.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 8. Practical Trade Rules\n",
      "- **Stop Loss:** Place a stop loss slightly below the medium-term EMA (148.75) to protect against downside risk.\n",
      "- **Take Profit:** Consider taking profits incrementally as the stock approaches key resistance levels or if the RSI approaches overbought levels (70+).\n",
      "- **Add to Position:** If the stock pulls back to the short-term EMA (150.25) and shows signs of support, consider adding to the position.\n",
      "- **Trend Strength and RSI Combination:**\n",
      "  - Strong trend (MA alignment + spread) combined with a non-overbought RSI suggests a favorable environment for long positions.\n",
      "  - Monitor RSI for signs of overbought conditions, which may indicate a potential pullback or consolidation phase.\n",
      "\n",

Moving Average Order\\n- **Short-term EMA (50-day):** `ema_st`\\n- **Medium-term EMA (100-day):** `ema_mt`\\n- **Long-term EMA (150-day):** `ema_lt`\\n\\n**Analysis:**\\n- The order of these moving averages can indicate the current trend direction:\\n  - If `ema_st > ema_mt > ema_lt`, it suggests a strong bullish trend.\\n  - If `ema_st < ema_mt < ema_lt`, it indicates a strong bearish trend.\\n  - Any other order suggests a potential consolidation or transition phase.\\n\\n### 2. Alignment\\n- **Bullish Alignment:** All moving averages are aligned in ascending order (short-term above medium-term above long-term).\\n- **Bearish Alignment:** All moving averages are aligned in descending order (short-term below medium-term below long-term).\\n- **Neutral/Transition:** Mixed order of moving averages.\\n\\n### 3. Slope of the Averages and Momentum\\n- **Positive Slope:** Indicates upward momentum if the moving averages are increasing.\\n- **Negative Slope:** Indicates downward momentum if the moving averages are decreasing.\\n- **Flat Slope:** Suggests a lack of momentum or a sideways market.\\n\\n### 4. Trend Phase\\n- **Accumulation Phase:** Characterized by a flat or slightly upward slope in moving averages, often before a bullish trend.\\n- **Advancing Phase:** Strong upward slope in moving averages, indicating a bullish trend.\\n- **Distribution Phase:** Flat or slightly downward slope, often before a bearish trend.\\n- **Declining Phase:** Strong downward slope, indicating a bearish trend.\\n\\n### 5.

Moving Average Order\\n- **Short-term EMA (50-day):** `ema_st`\\n- **Medium-term EMA (100-day):** `ema_mt`\\n- **Long-term EMA (150-day):** `ema_lt`\\n\\n**Analysis:**\\n- The order of these moving averages can indicate the current trend direction. If `ema_st > ema_mt > ema_lt`, it suggests a strong uptrend. Conversely, if `ema_st < ema_mt < ema_lt`, it indicates a strong downtrend.\\n\\n### 2. Alignment\\n- **Bullish Alignment:** All moving averages are aligned in ascending order (short-term above medium-term, medium-term above long-term).\\n- **Bearish Alignment:** All moving averages are aligned in descending order (short-term below medium-term, medium-term below long-term).\\n\\n### 3. Slope of the Averages and Momentum\\n- **Positive Slope:** If all moving averages are sloping upwards, it indicates positive momentum and a potential continuation of the uptrend.\\n- **Negative Slope:** If all moving averages are sloping downwards, it suggests negative momentum and a potential continuation of the downtrend.\\n\\n### 4. Trend Phase\\n- **Accumulation Phase:** If the short-term average is crossing above the medium and long-term averages, it may indicate the beginning of an uptrend.\\n- **Distribution Phase:** If the short-term average is crossing below the medium and long-term averages, it may indicate the beginning of a downtrend.\\n\\n### 5. Trading Implication\\n- **Bullish Scenario:** Consider entering long positions if the moving averages are in bullish alignment and the slope is positive.\\n- **Bearish Scenario:** Consider entering short positions if the moving averages are in bearish alignment and the slope is negative.\\n\\n### 6. Spread Interpretation\\n- **Spread between Short-term and Medium-term (spread_stmt):** A large positive spread indicates strong short-term momentum. A narrowing spread may suggest weakening momentum.\\n- **Spread between Medium-term and Long-term (spread_mtlt):** A large positive spread indicates strong medium-term momentum. A narrowing spread may suggest a potential trend reversal.\\n- **Spread between Short-term and Long-term (spread_stlt):** This spread provides an overall view of the trend strength.
